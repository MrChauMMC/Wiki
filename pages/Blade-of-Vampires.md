The Blade of Vampires is used mainly for its unique Life Steal enchantment. Notably, the effect stacks based on the number of entities hit with it per swing, meaning it is possible to recover full health in a single attack. The expected health recovery formula is as follows: (0.45)(4 HP)(n) = 1.8 HP * n, where n is the number of entities hit in the attack.<br>
It also pairs nicely with Protection-enchanted Armor because the health recovery is completely independent of Armor values.
