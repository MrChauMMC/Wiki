The Sword of Beheading is a [Weapon](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Weapons) added in Slimefun.<br>
It is an Iron Sword enchanted with Beheading II, which has a chance to drop a player's or mob's head upon killing them.<br><br>
It is crafted with 2 Emeralds, 1 Blaze Rod, and 2 [Tier II Magical Lumps](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items) in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table) as shown:<br>

The Sword of Beheading is a great alternative to obtaining mob heads (which is its primary use after all), which are ordinarily difficult to obtain. For example, without Looting enchantments a Wither Skeleton has a skull drop rate of 2.5% if killed by a player (or a tamed Wolf), so a Wither Skeleton is 10x more likely to drop its skull if killed with this Sword (see the table below). (Note: statistically the expected number of Wither Skeletons that must be killed to have enough skulls to summon a Wither is reduced from 120 to 12, a significant difference.)<br> Obtaining the  heads of Zombies, Skeletons, and Creepers is possible only if they are killed by a Charged Creeper's explosion, so the Sword of Beheading allows you to forgo waiting for a thunderstorm and luring a Creeper and instead kill the mobs yourself. Additionally, player heads are normally unobtainable in Survival mode, so this Sword provides the only method of obtaining those at all.

## Chance to drop head
The table belows lists the chance for each applicable entity to drop their head upon being killed.

| Entity type | Drop chance |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Player | 70% |
| Creeper | 40% |
| Skeleton | 40% |
| Zombie | 40% |
| Wither Skeleton | 25% |

If you are using the [ExtraHeads](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/ExtraHeads) addon, it also increases your chance to obtain heads from other mobs.
